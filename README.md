- 👋 Hi, I’m Peaches Ocampo
- 👀 I’m interested in applying my accounting and data analytics skills in one role. I enjoy mystery games, soduku and other challenging games. It's nice to get pieces of all puzzles and see the overall picture just like in business analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently polishing my coding skills in Python, SQL and R and also data visualization presentation talent in Tableau, Power BI and MS Excel
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more business analytics projects
- 📫 You could reach me at my personal email - peach.ocampo@gmail.com
